<h1><i><b>WHAT IS THIS SITE ALL ABOUT;</b></i></h1>
<h3>.......Talent management;</h3>
<p>Talent management is a modern terminology used to describe the linkage between what you are doing practically and with the knowledge or inner art one has to carry out his or her work. For example the words planning, implementing, workforce budget, recruitment strategies and so on all sound too basic but the important part you have to know is linking these words to the output of your workplace ie to say that those are the tools for any Business but you have to "right fit" these jargons to work output. Another example is I am an Administrative Officer, but I have worked in accounts as well some paralegal duties. My family background is that of construction. Now you will realise that I am multiskilled and this will lead me to talent management as my work at the moment involves administration,accounting, paralegal as well as HR Management.</p>
<br>
<h3>We also nurture talents;</h3> 
<p>To 'nurture' means to encourage and to help something to grow and develop.
<br>
If someone has a talent, they should be given every opportunity to develop it through encouragement, access to training and, in most cases these days, sufficient financial backing. If the person is at a very young age, they should not be pushed too hard or made to perform before they are ready. </p>

<h3>Debate on if one can be born with talents;</h3>
 No one is ever born with talents they may get be born with a love for it but but talents and skill is something you learn and you will never be perfect at anything at the start but will gain skill. I love art and wish to have a creative job. My mother is an artist and has always supported me with advice. Skills can be obtained only by practice I have been practicing since i could hold a pencil band that has help but don't be down hearted, anyone can be skillfull. Just practice and enjoy it if you don't theres no point forcing your self and do it for the love. A bit of help with sketching look at paintings and see how other people draw and try to impement it with your work .. good luck and keep trying :)

It's a little bit of both.
Even Picasso had to practice and hone his skills for him to be as skilled of an artist as he was. Sure, some of it was born. Genetic.
But some of why he was so good was because he practiced and practiced and practiced.
I was born with little artistic ability. But, since I love to draw and write and paint and the whole shebang I got better.
I'm almost sixteen, and when I look at stuff I did in the past you can see definite improvement because I PRACTICE all the time.(:
