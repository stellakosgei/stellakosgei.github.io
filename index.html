<h5><i><b><span style="color:pink;">Spokenwords</span></b></i></h5>
<p>Spoken word has existed for many years. Long before writing, through a cycle of practicing, listening and memorizing, each language drew on its resources of sound structure for aural patterns that made spoken poetry very different from ordinary discourse and easier to commit to memory</p>
<br>

<h5><b><i><span style="color:pink;">Singing</span></i></b></h5>
<p>Singing means making music with the voice. Singing is probably the way that music started many thousands of years ago. When people sing they make their voices go high or low. If they do this in a way that uses notes of a scale then they make tunes.

Some animals, such as many types of bird and whale, sing. Other animals, such as many types of cats, make musical purring sounds.

</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b><i><span style="color:pink;">Poetry</span></i></b></h5>
<p>Poetry is a type of art form and a type of literature.

Poetry uses the qualities of words, in different ways, to be artistic.

    different length and sound (of words)

(Poetry can be as short as a few words, or as long as a book (an epic).

    meanings (of words)
    (Poetry has) different uses of tone.

There are many "poetic forms" (forms of poetry).
<br> Some of them are : 
<br>Sonnet, Haiku, Ballad, Stev, Ode, Free verse, Blank verse, thematic, limerick and nursery rhymes.

Poetry can be used to describe (comparing, talking about, or expressing emotion) many things. It can make sense or be nonsense, it can rhyme or not. It can have many shapes and sizes; it can be serious or funny.

"To say something poetically" means to give information in an artistic way.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b><i><span style="color:pink;">Games</span></i></b></h5>
<p>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b><i><span style="color:pink;">Comedy and Drama</span></i></b></h5>
Comedy-drama, occasionally known as dramedy (portmanteau of words drama and comedy), is a subgenre in contemporary forms of tragicomedy, especially in open forums.
